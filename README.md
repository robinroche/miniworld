# miniworld

A Matlab implementation of H. Bossel's MiniWorld model.

### Licence

None. Feel free to use it as you wish.

### Model description

The MiniWorld model is a Matlab implementation of Hartmut Bossel's [MiniWorld model](http://www.systo.org/miniworld.html), described in his book entitled "Systems and models". The model has three state variables (population, pollution, capital) that evolve over time, depending on chosen parameters, such as the birth and death rates. The model is interesting as it provides a simple way of simulating how the world could evolve depending on some hypothesis.

### Source code

The Matlab code for the model and simulation is available in the attached file miniworld.m. The model parameters and the initial values of the state variables can be changed directly in the script.

### Sample output

The following curves are obtained using the default initial values (all state variables set to 1).
